Install the java JDK from this link (latest version):
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Once the JDK is installed it will be helpful to add the JDK's bin folder to the System variable path.

(on a Windows Operating System)
1. Go to "Computer".
2. Open "System properties".
3. Open "Advanced System settings".
4. Open "Environment Variables..."
5. Under "System variables" find and select the variable "Path" and click edit.
6. Add a semicolon ";" to the end of the "Variable value" and then add the location of your JDK's bin directory. ex. "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45\bin"

To check if your install and setup were successfull open command prompt and type the command "java -version" and "javac -version".
